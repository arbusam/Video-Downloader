# Here are 4 different cron examples. Use the one that is most appropriate for your use-case.
# Remember to read the crontab section from README.md before attempting these examples.


# Example 1 - Running a Python script (using the Python interpreter)
# (remember to change the path to to match your directory structure)
# * * * * * cd /Users/ceogavin/My_Git_Code/[CaptainCodeAU]/My_Video_Downloader_Z; .venv/bin/python cron/example1.py 1>> cron/logs/output.txt 2>> cron/logs/errors.txt


# Example 2 - Calling a stand-alone Python script
# Note: The first line in example2.py is important! It contains the location of the python interpreter.
# Important: Before adding this line in your crontab, you must first change this file to an 'executable' type.
# You can do that using the following command (remember to change the path to reflect your directory structure) -
# chmod +x cron/example2.py
* * * * * cd /Users/ceogavin/My_Git_Code/[CaptainCodeAU]/My_Video_Downloader_Z; ./cron/example2.py 1>> cron/logs/output.txt 2>> cron/logs/errors.txt


# Example 3 - Calling a shell script
# Note: Before adding this line in your crontab, you must first change this file to an 'executable' type.
# You can do that using the following command (remember to change the path to reflect your directory structure) -
# chmod +x cron/example3.sh
* * * * * cd /Users/ceogavin/My_Git_Code/[CaptainCodeAU]/My_Video_Downloader_Z; ./cron/example3.sh 1>> cron/logs/output.txt 2>> cron/logs/errors.txt


# Example 4 - Using the 'poetry run' command
* * * * * cd /Users/ceogavin/My_Git_Code/[CaptainCodeAU]/My_Video_Downloader_Z; source ./.venv/bin/activate; POETRY_PATH=$(which poetry); $POETRY_PATH run url_dump --help 1>> cron/logs/output.txt 2>> cron/logs/errors.txt
